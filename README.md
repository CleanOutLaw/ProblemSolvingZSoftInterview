# ProblemSolvingZSoftInterview
Giving another thought to the problem I was asked to solve during the ZSOFT Consulting Interview.
The Main.java program checks if the string contains a sequence of the same character
consecutively in such a way that the number of occurrences is at least equal to an int n.
# ABBDCA, 2    -> true
# BAAABDBB, 3  -> true
# BAABDB, 3    -> false
# BBBBBBBB, 8  -> true
# Empty string, 0  -> true
